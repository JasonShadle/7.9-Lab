7.9-Lab: Craps Game
=======
One of the early labs I did in AP Computer Science. We needed to recreate a version
of the dice game "Craps". We were given an outline of how it was supposed to be done
(just the methods and their constructors) and it was our job to fill in the rest.
We had some guidance and hints on what to do and how to do it as we were still
learning, but it was a good start.
